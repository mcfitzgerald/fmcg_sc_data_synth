# Prism Sim

A high-fidelity supply chain simulation engine built on the principles of Supply Chain Physics.

## Core Principles

This project adheres strictly to the laws of Supply Chain Physics to ensure kinematic consistency and mass balance in all simulations. See [physics.md](physics.md) for the theoretical framework and validation rubric.

## Key Frameworks
- Little's Law
- VUT Equation (Kingman's Formula)
- Mass Balance
- Signal Resonance (Bullwhip Effect)
