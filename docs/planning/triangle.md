# The Supply Chain Triangle

Based on the work of Prof. Dr. Bram Desmet, the **Supply Chain Triangle** is a framework for balancing the conflicting objectives of a business to maximize shareholder value. It connects operational metrics to financial results, specifically **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)**.

## 1. The Core Framework
The triangle consists of three interconnected corners. Tension is inherent; pulling on one corner inevitably stresses the others.

### A. Service (The Top)
*   **Definition:** The value proposition delivered to the customer.
*   **Metrics:** Service levels (fill rate, lead time), product portfolio breadth, order flexibility.
*   **Financial Proxy:** **Gross Margin** or Revenue. (Higher service/premium product commands higher price).

### B. Cost (The Right)
*   **Definition:** The operational expenses required to execute.
*   **Operational Costs:** Sourcing, manufacturing, warehousing, logistics.
*   **Non-Operational Costs:** R&D and SG&A (Selling, General & Administrative).
*   **Financial Proxy:** **EBIT** (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) is the result of Revenue minus Costs.

### C. Cash / Capital Employed (The Left)
*   **Definition:** The investment tied up in the business to facilitate flow.
*   **Working Capital:** Inventory + Accounts Receivable (AR) - Accounts Payable (AP).
*   **Fixed Assets:** Machinery, plants, trucks.
*   **Metric:** **Inventory Turns** is the dominant proxy for complexity and capital efficiency.

## 2. The Financial North Star: ROCE
The goal of supply chain management is not just to reduce cost or inventory in isolation, but to optimize the **Return on Capital Employed**.

$$ ROCE = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Capital Employed}} $$

*   **EBIT** = Service (Revenue) - Cost
*   **Capital Employed** = Working Capital (Inventory) + Fixed Assets

**The Insight:** Investors accept lower margins (EBIT) if the capital requirement is low (high efficiency). Conversely, they accept high capital requirements if the margins are massive.

## 3. The Dynamics of Tension
Functional silos often pull in opposing directions, breaking the triangle:
*   **Sales (Service):** Wants broad portfolio and high stock for immediate availability $\rightarrow$ Increases Inventory (Cash) and Complexity (Cost).
*   **Operations (Cost):** Wants long production runs and low-wage sourcing $\rightarrow$ Increases Batch Stock and Transit Inventory (Cash).
*   **Finance (Cash):** Wants to slash inventory $\rightarrow$ Hurts Service and disrupts Operations (Cost).

**Key Takeaway:** You cannot optimize all three simultaneously. You must choose a balance based on strategy.

## 4. Strategic Mapping (Treacy & Wiersema)
Different business strategies require different "shapes" of the triangle.

| Strategy | Focus | Triangle Profile | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational Excellence** | Total Cost & Efficiency | **Low Cost, Low Inventory.** <br>Standardized service. High asset utilization. | *Ryanair, Walmart* |
| **Product Leadership** | Innovation & Performance | **High Service (Margin), High Cost.** <br>High complexity/inventory (niche parts). High R&D spend. | *Apple, Intel* |
| **Customer Intimacy** | Solution & Adaptability | **Balanced / Medium.** <br>High flexibility. Broad portfolio leads to moderate complexity. | *IBM, Sysco* |

### Strategic Implications
1.  **OpEx:** "No-nonsense." Win by being the cheapest and easiest to buy from. Inventory turns are king.
2.  **Product Leader:** "Best Product." Win by premium features. High margins cover the waste (obsolete stock, R&D) inherent in innovation.
3.  **Customer Intimacy:** "Best Solution." Win by tailoring to the client. Higher sales costs (SG&A) to manage relationships.

## 5. Summary
*   **No Man is an Island:** Decisions in Sourcing or Sales impact Inventory and ROCE.
*   **Don't Benchmark Blindly:** An OpEx company should have higher inventory turns than a Product Leader. Comparing them directly is flawed.
*   **Alignment:** Successful transformation requires aligning the Supply Chain Triangle with the corporate strategy (OpEx vs. Innovation).
